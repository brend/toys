# toys
things to bring to a Playdate

## what is this
a library of data structures and algorithms that help me learning Lua und will hopefully one day be useful in developing a game for Panic's Playdate <3

## what's in the toybox
toys contains several modules
- list: automatically growing list datastructure that supports appending and prepending
- stack: stack implementation based on the list module
- dfa: deterministic finite automata with user defined states
